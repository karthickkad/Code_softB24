## âœ… Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Description**:  
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked port
- SibSp and Parch

**Model Type**: Classification  
**Possible Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
**Output**: 0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived  
**Dataset**: Titanic Dataset (CSV file)

## âœ… Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

**Description**:  
Build a regression model that predicts movie ratings based on features like:
- Genre
- Director
- Leading actors/actresses
- Budget and revenue (if available)

**Model Type**: Regression  
**Possible Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost  
**Output**: Predicted rating (e.g., 6.8 out of 10)  
**Dataset**: Movie Dataset (CSV file)

## âœ… Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

**Description**:  
Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

**Model Type**: Classification  
**Possible Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree  
**Output**: Predicted species name  
**Dataset**: Iris Dataset (CSV file or from sklearn.datasets)
