# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* â€” based on their **sepal and petal measurements**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:

- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
- `species` (Target: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## ðŸ§  Model

We use a **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn` to build a classification model. The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure `IRIS.csv` is present in the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
